## Summary

Provides an independently reproducible mechanism that permits verification of a specific Element.

## Description

An IntegrityMethod provides an independently reproducible mechanism that permits verification
of a specific Element that correlates to the data in this SPDX document. This identifier enables
a recipient to determine if anything in the original Element has been changed and eliminates
confusion over which version or modification of a specific Element is referenced.

The recommended method to verify the integrity of `SoftwareArtifacts` Elements (including `Files`, `Snippets`, and `Packages`) is to use the SoftwareArtifactâ€™s `contentIdentifier` property.
